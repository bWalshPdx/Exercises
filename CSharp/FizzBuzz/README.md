# FizzBuzz Kata

## Purpose

Better understanding the Bob Martin approach of TDD

Learning how and when to use AceJump

Burning in shortcut keys for visual studio

## Exercise

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/fizzbuzz/problem
```
Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. 

For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 

For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 

For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
```

## Research:
Learning how to make a readme. (Thinking about using it as my journal for solo katas):
https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

Xunit can't run on .net standard. Moving to full framework after some small amount of research.

Learning how to use AceJump for Ctrl + alt + ;

## Retrospective:

I have been burning in Bob Martin's 3 rules of TDD and the shortkeys for visual studio.
