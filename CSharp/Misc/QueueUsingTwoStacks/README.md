--NA 2020.07.13.09.05.41AM: Work on making a datastructure that can enqueue a element

<NA> 2020.07.14.09.01.30AM: I need to make the head the tail something list Next = this (But without the reference issues) (Some sort of deep copy?)

<NA> 2020.07.15.08.47.15AM: Fiddling with value types via a 'valuetuple' and adding the head to the tail.

<NA> 2020.07.15.05.37.04PM: Still working on deepcopy of head and tail.

<NA> 2020.07.16.09.08.52AM: Failing solve test. integrating final switch


<NA> 2020.07.17.09.29.17AM: Need to fix my 'enqueue' so it puts people at the back of the line


	- My tests were written wrong, it should be:
		- Figure out on paper what it should be doing
		- Write tests to reflect what was written out on paper
		- Get tests to pass
		- Goto 10 until exercise is solved.

   - Update 'Developer Keybindings' to know how to find that particular shortcut again if it ever gets reset.

   - I would like to fix the windows shared clipboard

   <NA> <DONE>@:2020.07.20.08.46.40AM: change Enqueue to be recursive

  <NA> <DONE>@:2020.07.20.09.26.47AM: Look at why test cases are not working (The guiding tests)

  <NA> 2020.07.24.08.46.25AM: Its correct, it just needs to be faster.

  <NA> 2020.07.27.09.24.37AM: Fixing error with printout when keeping track of the tail and the head.

I completed the excercise

It went fairly smoothly

-- Things that could go better:
--------------------------------------

I need to physically write out my work and translate those to tests. I did need to refactor a bit and I did get confused on some of the basics of queues.

Write out your normal workflow and figure out the shortkeys. Put those shortkeys on your monitor only when you are working on a feature or exercise.
