## Lessons

- There was a pretty big leap when moving a function from one class to another, need to clean that up.
    - Figure out how to move a function to a existing class. Or create a class in the same file, then create a new class file to move it into.

- Also need to learn how to auto clean a class

## Log

Moved the reporting into its own special class. Making room for cleaning up the classes to be in their own tests.
