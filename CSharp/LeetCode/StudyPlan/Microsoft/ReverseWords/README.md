## Prepping for writing the Solution

### Rules of the Problem:
- A word is a string of non-space charactes
- The words with be seperate by AT LEAST one space
- Return a string of the words in reverse order seperated by a single space
- The string may contain leading spaces

### Proposed tests for each rule:

x - The sperator can handle leading blank spaces
x - The seperator can handle multiple spaces
x- the sperator will add non space characters
x - Reverse words will reverse the words given to it.


## Reflection:

### What are the best aspects of the design of the code weâ€™ve ended up with?

I thought this very simple and it was a good test case of breaking down the problem into test cases and working 
through them one at a time. 

Also I had a good opportunity to practice the "Step down rule" for function naming and composition.

### In what ways did we do Test Driven Development particularly well?

Writing up all the test cases, then working through each one was great.

### Did we learn anything new?

Nothing new, just practicing things that I need to burn into my brain.

### Did anything unexpected happen?

This was the smoothest it could pretty much possibly be.

### What do we still need to practice more?

Keep practicing breaking down the problem and going through the test cases.

### What should we do differently in the next dojo?

I thought this was a good process, I could possibly write it again as a very simple state machine.

### What will you do differently tomorrow in your production code?

Nothing, this was very simple.
