## Prepping for writing the Solution

### Rules of the Problem:
- A word is a string of non-space charactes
- The words with be seperate by AT LEAST one space
- Return a string of the words in reverse order seperated by a single space
- The string may contain leading spaces

### Proposed tests for each rule:

x - The sperator can handle leading blank spaces
x - The seperator can handle multiple spaces
x- the sperator will add non space characters
- Reverse words will reverse the words given to it.


## Reflection:

### What are the best aspects of the design of the code weâ€™ve ended up with?


### In what ways did we do Test Driven Development particularly well?


### Did we learn anything new?


### Did anything unexpected happen?


### What do we still need to practice more?


### What should we do differently in the next dojo?


### What will you do differently tomorrow in your production code?
