## Prepping for writing the Solution

### Rules of the Problem:

- The function reverses a string

- This input char array must be modified in-place O(1) extra memory.
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm
    - However, a small amount of extra storage space is allowed for auxiliary variables.

### Proposed tests for each rule:

## Reflection:

### What are the best aspects of the design of the code weâ€™ve ended up with?


### In what ways did we do Test Driven Development particularly well?


### Did we learn anything new?


### Did anything unexpected happen?


### What do we still need to practice more?


### What should we do differently in the next dojo?


### What will you do differently tomorrow in your production code?
