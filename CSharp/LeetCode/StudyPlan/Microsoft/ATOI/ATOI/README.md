## Reflection:

### What are the best aspects of the design of the code we’ve ended up with?

Well, this code got a bit out of hand. I think there is a point when writing code when I can feel where the code is going, 
maybe a design pattern emerges and I refactor. I think I thought I was almost done. I know me looking at the description 
longer would have helped with making that decision about when to make that change. 

### In what ways did we do Test Driven Development particularly well?

I think all the test cases really helped ensure I could safely change the bad code without fear of things breaking.


### Did we learn anything new?

I did'nt learn anything new, but I should have. Maybe split the code up and write a dfa instead a bunch of gross if else statements.

### Did anything unexpected happen?

yeah, there were so many corner cases with over 1200 test cases.

### What do we still need to practice more?

Writing a dfa

### What should we do differently in the next dojo?

Start writing out the dfa and work start with the simplest case.

### What will you do differently tomorrow in your production code?

This was much more complicated than production code.
