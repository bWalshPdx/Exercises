## Reflection:

### What are the best aspects of the design of the code weâ€™ve ended up with?


### In what ways did we do Test Driven Development particularly well?


### Did we learn anything new?


### Did anything unexpected happen?


### What do we still need to practice more?


### What should we do differently in the next dojo?


### What will you do differently tomorrow in your production code?
