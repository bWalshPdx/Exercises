## Prepping for writing the Solution

I mainly followed the DFA provided by the solution. After that I just followed each transition to each state and it was pretty simple from there.

## Reflection:

### What are the best aspects of the design of the code weâ€™ve ended up with?

DFA's are really amazing, if I can figure out how to diagram one, then I can write one in code.

### In what ways did we do Test Driven Development particularly well?

I could write a test of a given state and each transition. After that I wrote some tests getting the states to work together, but yeah it was way less trial and error.

### Did we learn anything new?

I did further lock down how to write a simple DFA.

### Did anything unexpected happen?

Nothing crazy unexpected, other than getting the accepted answer quickly.

### What do we still need to practice more?

How to write a diagram a DFA better.

### What should we do differently in the next dojo?

I should write out how to tackle this much better, as well as force myself to read the solutions and study them so I can feel better when something similar to this comes my way.

### What will you do differently tomorrow in your production code?

Nothing currently, unless I run into a problem that requires a DFA.

One this, this solution did do was say: 

"And write down all the rules for building the integer for each one these characters which will help us in writing down the conditions while building the algorithm."

So I need to write down all the rules. Added to template.
